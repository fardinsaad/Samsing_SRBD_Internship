# Summary of My Internship at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh (SRBD)

During my two-month internship at **Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh (SRBD)**, from **November 18, 2018**, I was part of the **Mobile Application 2 Group**, under the supervision of **M. Shaykat Shuva** and **Faisal Khan**, along with guidance from **Arnab Sen Sharma** and **Maruf Ahmed Mridul**. My main project involved working on a **Robot Project**, focusing on various modules related to **Android Studio** and **Continuous Speech Recognition**. Here’s a breakdown of the key work I accomplished:

## Key Work and Achievements

### 1. Continuous Speech Recognition
- I implemented **PocketSphinx** for continuous speech recognition in Android devices.
- Built a custom **Continuous Speech Recognition App** using the PocketSphinx library, recognizing multiple commands like "start," "stop," "capture," "playback," and "baby cry."
- I faced challenges with **accuracy (57.85%)** due to limitations of PocketSphinx and began exploring **Acoustic Model Adaptation** to improve recognition performance.

### 2. Testing and Debugging
- I was responsible for **testing, debugging, and optimizing** a Continuous Speech Application provided by the project developer, which relied on server-based recognition instead of PocketSphinx.
- After testing with a paragraph of 117 words, I achieved an accuracy of **94.01%**.
- I identified a major bug related to the **Recognition Service Busy** error and successfully optimized the application by adjusting delay timers and removing unnecessary onEndOfSpeech delays.

### 3. Developed a Video Recorder App
- I built a video recording application using **Android Studio**, which involved studying and implementing the **Camera API**.
- I handled technical challenges like **resolution, aspect ratio control, and orientation adjustments** to ensure the highest video quality.

### 4. Voice Recognition/Authentication APIs
- Conducted research on various voice recognition and authentication APIs and machine learning models, including **Voice Vault Biometrics**, **Microsoft Speaker Recognition API**, **Voice Print Recognition System**, and **TensorFlow Speech Recognition**.
- I reported my findings to the project’s main developer for further exploration.

### 5. Baby Cry Detection App
- I created a dataset of **108 audio files** each for "baby cry," "baby laugh," "noise," and "silence" to aid in the development of the **Baby Cry Detection App**.
- I implemented a **dynamic list** that displayed predicted inputs like "baby cry" and "baby laugh" in color-coded text (e.g., red for "baby cry").
- I studied **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** to improve feature extraction and detection accuracy, and presented my findings to the main developer.

## Conclusion
Throughout the internship, I gained valuable experience in **Android development**, **speech recognition technologies**, and **application development**. I demonstrated problem-solving skills, especially in debugging and optimizing apps, and contributed significantly to multiple project modules. I also received continuous support and guidance from my supervisors and mentors, helping me grow both technically and professionally.
